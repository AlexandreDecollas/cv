      "I always aim my action in client business point of view. Actually, what point makes the dev if he doesn't bring value?",
      "That's why I want to reach the approach \"Software Craftman\" defined by Sandro Mancuso. Practicing TDD (Test Driven Development) is for me as important as the communication with different project characters. I've acquire the deep conviction that the developer action as an adviser, communicator and technician grants a higher chance for the project to perform a good progress.",
      "In such a domain, up-to-date knowledge is a critical point. It brings a lot of value to the developer. That's why I look regularly tutorials, conferences, articles... My bedside books are either generalists (The software craftmanship, Clean Code, Clean Architecture etc) or more technicals (spring in action, TDD by example etc). I aim to maintain my skills updated. It allows me to have the choice of the approach when I need to tackle a problem. At the right moment, I can choose the best.",
