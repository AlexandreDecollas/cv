                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Alexandre Decollas, <span id="age"></span>. After <span id="years-xp"></span> years of
                        experience in development industry, I started by
                        passion
                        for sciences and IT to a passion for beautiful code especially and what it brings to the
                        business. </p>
                    <p> I always aim my action in client business point of
                        view. Actually, what point makes the dev if he doesn't bring value? </p>
                    <p> That's why I want to reach the approach "Software
                        Craftman" defined by Sandro Mancuso. Practicing TDD (Test Driven Development) is for me as
                        important as
                        the communication with different project characters. I've acquire the deep conviction that the
                        developer
                        action as an adviser, communicator and technician grants a higher chance for the project to
                        perform a
                        good progress. </p>
                    <p> In such a domain, up-to-date knowledge is a
                        critical point. It brings a lot of value to the developer. That's why I look regularly
                        tutorials,
                        conferences, articles... My bedside books are either generalists (The software craftmanship,
                        Clean Code,
                        Clean Architecture etc) or more technicals (spring in action, TDD by example etc). I aim to
                        maintain my
                        skills updated. It allows me to have the choice of the approach when I need to tackle a problem.
                        At the
                        right moment, I can choose the best. </p>
                    <p> During my career, I had occasion to endorse lead
                        dev role. I discovered that I love to transmit my knowledge. It's an important part of the job,
                        and it
                        pushes to increase my knowledge. "To teach is to learn twice" - Joseph Joubert </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the context of my personal project, "yoda.prof", I undertook the development of a
                                    SaaS dedicated to online training, utilizing a variety of digital content such as
                                    videos, slides, and PDFs. The goal was to create an intuitive and engaging platform,
                                    enabling users to effectively learn and train in various fields.</p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the key innovations of "yoda.prof" was the integration of artificial
                                    intelligence to offer predetermined training scenarios. This feature aimed to
                                    provide a personalized learning experience, adapting the journey according to the
                                    progress and specific needs of each user.

                                <p>
                                    Although "yoda.prof" did not evolve into a startup, this project allowed me to
                                    deepen my skills in developing SaaS solutions and integrating AI into web
                                    applications. I faced various technical challenges, including the management of
                                    digital content, optimizing user experience, and implementing AI models to support
                                    interactive and adaptive learning.

                                    This personal project was an enriching experience, providing a platform to
                                    experiment with advanced technologies and explore the possibilities offered by AI in
                                    the field of digital education. It highlighted my ability to turn an idea into a

                                    April 2022 - October 2023</p>
                                <p>
                                    At Aptic, I was involved in an ambitious project to completely overhaul their
                                    application, a platform that mediates between training centers, funding
                                    organizations, and learners facing barriers to accessing digital tools. This mission
                                    highlighted the importance of creating an accessible, intuitive, and high-performing
                                    solution, tailored to the specific needs of each user group.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The rebuild from scratch required the establishment of new architectures for both
                                    the front-end and back-end, thus ensuring a solid foundation for the development and
                                    future expansion of the application. This fundamental step involved careful design,
                                    aimed at optimizing user experience, system performance, and maintainability.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The development of the necessary functionalities for this overhaul was guided by a
                                    deep understanding of the challenges faced by end-users, particularly accessibility
                                    for those who struggle with digital tools. This included creating clear and simple
                                    user interfaces, implementing interactive guides, and ensuring compatibility with
                                    various devices and technological aids.
                                </p>

                                    This work at Aptic highlighted my ability to transform complex and varied
                                    requirements into concrete and effective technical solutions. It also demonstrated
                                    my commitment to developing applications that not only meet the immediate needs of
                                    users but also facilitate broader inclusion, making education and training more
                                    accessible to everyone. This project was a significant opportunity to contribute to
                                    an important social cause while tackling stimulating technical challenges.

                                    December 2022 - September 2023</p>
                                <p>

                                    At Primobox, I played a pivotal role in the digital transformation of their legacy
                                    HR management application, leading the development of a modern front-end and
                                    significantly contributing to the back-end architecture. This project involved
                                    creating a solid foundation for the application's renewal while ensuring the
                                    continuity and enhancement of the services offered.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The front-end overhaul was accomplished by establishing an innovative architecture
                                    for two distinct applications, while sharing a common local library. Developed and
                                    managed via Storybook, this library enabled efficient harmonization and reuse of
                                    UI/UX components, thus facilitating consistent development and maintenance of the
                                    applications. This approach not only optimized development resources but also
                                    enhanced the overall user experience with a unified and intuitive user interface.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Besides the front-end work, I also developed back-end functionalities, contributing
                                    to the application's robustness and scalability. This required a deep understanding
                                    of the specific business needs in HR management, as well as the rigorous application
                                    of best practices in software development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Furthermore, I embraced the role of mentor within the team, guiding developers in
                                    their proficiency in Angular and Jest. Through targeted training sessions and
                                    continuous support, the team quickly became autonomous and skilled, thereby
                                    strengthening Primobox's ability to innovate and efficiently meet its clients'
                                    demands.

                                    July 2021 - April 2022</p>
                                <p>
                                    At PrestaShop, I had the unique opportunity to contribute to the development of two
                                    open-source libraries, strengthening the technical infrastructure of the platform
                                    and facilitating the integration of modern and scalable technologies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first task was updating PrestaShop's core library. This update allowed
                                    PrestaShop to efficiently integrate the CQRS library from NestJS with the EventStore
                                    database, marking a significant technical evolution. Thanks to this library,
                                    PrestaShop could benefit from a more robust and scalable architecture, thereby
                                    optimizing the management of events and commands within the application.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The second contribution was developing an interconnection library designed to
                                    abstract and facilitate communication between two projects using different and
                                    incompatible versions of EventStore. This innovation solved a major compatibility
                                    challenge, enabling smooth and seamless interaction between various components of
                                    the PrestaShop ecosystem, despite version discrepancies.
                                </p>

                                    These projects at PrestaShop allowed me to demonstrate my ability to work on complex
                                    open-source solutions, requiring a deep understanding of modern software
                                    architectures and the ability to solve high-level technical problems. My work
                                    contributed to the continuous improvement of the PrestaShop platform, enhancing its
                                    flexibility, scalability, and capacity to integrate cutting-edge technologies.

                                    Initially on an "emergency" mission, it was crucial to deploy the flagship product
                                    for a key client. I took the lead on important topics and onboarded new arrivals.
                                    Once this client was successfully launched, we established a team topology that
                                    enabled the industrialization of development:
                                </p>

                                        Introduced end-to-end testing (cucumber/puppeteer) to support the team's sole QA

                                    <li>
                                        Developed new features as part of these sprints

                                    At Maincare, following the acquisition of a company introducing a new development
                                    framework, I was tasked with mastering this framework and creating POCs to
                                    demonstrate its mechanics, aiming to enhance our team's skills. This challenge
                                    proved to be an opportunity to showcase our team's ability to tackle technical

                                    At Betclic, I was involved in developing features for the company's web application,
                                    using Angular versions 5, 6, and 7. This initial phase of work continued until
                                    February, when the project shifted in a new direction. Starting in February, a
                                    unique opportunity arose: to contribute to the development, from the early stages,
                                    of a brand new brand for Betclic. This project, highly confidential before its
                                    launch, was an exciting and demanding adventure. By adopting Angular 7 for this
                                    initiative, our team dove into a rich and complex development environment.

                                    The use of RxJS was central to our work, with particular attention paid to managing
                                    memory leaks. The implementation of Server Side Rendering (SSR) added an extra layer
                                    of technical innovation to our project. Our commitment to Clean Code and SOLID
                                    principles, along with the rigorous application of Test-Driven Development (TDD),
                                    were essential to maintaining our code's high quality and reliability.

                                    At La Banque Postale, I contributed to the development of several applications,
                                    leveraging my expertise in Spring and Angular technologies. These projects allowed
                                    me to implement innovative solutions that met specific needs in a demanding and
                                    highly secure environment.

                                    One of the standout projects was the development from scratch of a password
                                    management application. To achieve this, I designed a robust back-end using Spring,
                                    paired with a dynamic front-end in Angular 4, all while integrating OpenDJ as the
                                    LDAP server. This project enabled me to tackle challenges related to securing and
                                    efficiently managing user access.

                                    Additionally, I was involved in creating REST services, utilizing the power of
                                    Spring and adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This method, based on
                                    writing source code guided by unit tests, was crucial for ensuring the quality and
                                    reliability of the developed services, strictly following the provided technical

                                <p>

                                    At La Banque Postale, I played a key role in the evolution of the internal portal
                                    for branch advisors. This mission required innovative and technical development,
                                    covering both front-end and back-end aspects to enhance the efficiency and user
                                    experience of advisors.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    For the front-end part, I worked with FwAd, a proprietary framework inspired by
                                    AngularJS, chosen for its ability to provide a smooth and responsive user
                                    experience. This technology enabled me to develop intuitive and efficient
                                    interfaces, simplifying the daily operations of branch advisors with streamlined
                                    navigation and enhanced functionalities.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    On the back-end side, I utilized Java with Spring Boot and Maven, adopting a REST
                                    architecture to ensure the robustness and scalability of services. This approach
                                    allowed for the creation of effective back-end solutions capable of managing large
                                    volumes of data while ensuring optimal performance.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    The project was carried out in an AGILE context, with several development teams
                                    working in parallel on different aspects of the portal. This collaboration required
                                    tight coordination and fluid communication between teams to master a vast and
                                    complex functional set. My involvement in this project not only strengthened my
                                    technical skills in full-stack development but also honed my ability to work
                                    effectively within AGILE teams, thereby contributing to the continuous improvement
                                    of the internal portal used by banking advisors.

                                <p>

                                    At EDF, I contributed to the design and development of a POC (Proof of Concept) for
                                    a user interface, demonstrating my ability to navigate complex and evolving
                                    technological environments. This project enabled me to apply my front-end and
                                    back-end development skills, as well as actively participate in an Agile development
                                    process.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    The front-end development started with Angular2, before transitioning to React
                                    following a strategic technological direction change. This experience not only
                                    strengthened my flexibility and ability to adapt to different technology stacks but
                                    also allowed me to contribute to the creation of a responsive and high-performance
                                    user interface. On the back-end side, I worked with Java and Spring Data on an
                                    Apache JBoss server, developing robust and reliable REST services.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Agile methodology was at the heart of this project, with my active participation in
                                    planning poker, designing user stories, and breaking them down into weighted tasks.
                                    Working closely with the team and the client, along with the support of several
                                    SCRUM Masters, we maintained transparent communication and frequent updates on
                                    project progress. This methodology ensured a rapid adaptation to client feedback,
                                    thus optimizing the development of the POC.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I also played a key role in implementing new features on both the front and back
                                    ends and in writing unit tests for the front end using Karma. My contribution was
                                    crucial for the preparation and success of regular demonstrations, showcasing our
                                    progress and receiving constructive feedback for continuous adjustments. This
                                    project at EDF was a great opportunity to demonstrate my technical expertise while
                                    developing a client-centered approach in an Agile framework.

                                    On the front end, I managed the integration of modifications and the addition of new
                                    features, using JavaScript and CSS to strictly adhere to Orange's graphical charter.
                                    This included creating and modifying AJAX calls, essential for enhancing the
                                    application's interactivity and the overall user experience.

                                    This mission at Orange offered me the opportunity to demonstrate my ability to
                                    effectively contribute to the growth of a technological project, ensuring the

                                    2014 - August 2015</p>

                                <p>

                                    At Yellow Pages, my role focused on automating various manual tasks, a challenge
                                    that required a deep understanding of internal processes and the ability to develop
                                    innovative solutions to optimize operational efficiency.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I contributed to automating a significant part of the data integration chain, a
                                    project that significantly reduced the time and resources needed to process and
                                    integrate vast data sets into the company's systems. To achieve this, I developed a
                                    Java application with a SWING user interface, thus facilitating end-user interaction
                                    with the automation process.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    The use of the POI API for modifying Excel documents was a key aspect of this
                                    project, allowing for efficient and precise data manipulation within spreadsheets.
                                    Moreover, integration with the Oracle DBMS through its API enabled smooth data
                                    management between applications and the database, thus ensuring the integrity and
                                    security of the processed information.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    To complement these automations, I also developed Excel macros in VBA, aimed at
                                    further accelerating data processing. These macros optimized internal workflows,
                                    reducing the time needed for recurring tasks and thus improving overall
                                    productivity.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    My time at Yellow Pages highlighted my ability to identify process optimization
                                    opportunities and develop advanced technological solutions to address them. This
                                    project not only improved the company's operational efficiency but also contributed
                                    to better resource allocation, freeing up time for higher-value tasks.

                                    In this dynamic startup, I was tasked with developing new features for the main
                                    application, directly addressing the evolving needs of clients. My work was based on
                                    Java J2EE, a technology of choice for creating robust and scalable solutions in a
                                    rapidly changing environment.

                                    In addition to feature development, I implemented a server monitoring solution using
                                    Nagios. This initiative enabled real-time surveillance and proactive management of
                                    IT infrastructures, thus ensuring optimal availability and performance of the
                                    services offered by the startup. Integrating Nagios into our ecosystem marked a
                                    turning point in how we approached system maintenance and reliability, providing
                                    unprecedented visibility into the state of our infrastructure.
